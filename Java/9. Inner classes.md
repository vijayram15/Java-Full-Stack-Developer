Let’s delve into **9. Inner Classes**, a powerful feature in Java that enables better organization, logical grouping, and encapsulation of code within classes.

### **What Are Inner Classes?**

Inner classes are classes defined inside another class or interface. They are primarily used to group closely related code, encapsulate logic, and simplify event handling in applications like GUIs. Inner classes have full access to members (even private ones) of the outer class.

### **Types of Inner Classes in Java**

#### **1. Nested Inner Classes**
Non-static classes declared within another class.

- **Example:**
  ```java
  class OuterClass {
      class InnerClass {
          void display() {
              System.out.println("Inside Nested Inner Class");
          }
      }
  }
  public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          OuterClass outer = new OuterClass();
          OuterClass.InnerClass inner = outer.new InnerClass();
          inner.display();
      }
  }
  ```

---

#### **2. Static Nested Classes**
Static classes declared within another class. They do not need an instance of the outer class to be accessed.

- **Example:**
  ```java
  class OuterClass {
      static class InnerClass {
          void display() {
              System.out.println("Inside Static Nested Class");
          }
      }
  }
  public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          OuterClass.InnerClass inner = new OuterClass.InnerClass();
          inner.display();
      }
  }
  ```

---

#### **3. Local Inner Classes**
Classes defined within a method or block. They are accessible only within the enclosing method or block and can interact with `final` or effectively final variables of the enclosing method.

- **Example:**
  ```java
  class OuterClass {
      void outerMethod() {
          class InnerClass {
              void display() {
                  System.out.println("Inside Local Inner Class");
              }
          }
          InnerClass inner = new InnerClass();
          inner.display();
      }
  }
  public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          OuterClass outer = new OuterClass();
          outer.outerMethod();
      }
  }
  ```

#### **4. Anonymous Inner Classes**
Classes without names, used for short-lived implementations of interfaces or abstract classes.

- **Example:**
  ```java
  interface Greeting {
      void sayHello();
  }

  public class Main {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          Greeting greeting = new Greeting() {
              @Override
              public void sayHello() {
                  System.out.println("Hello from Anonymous Inner Class!");
              }
          };
          greeting.sayHello();
      }
  }
  ```

### **Advantages of Inner Classes**
1. **Logical Grouping:** Keeps related classes together for better organization.  
2. **Encapsulation:** Inner classes can access private members of the outer class, improving modularity.  
3. **Event Handling:** Frequently used in GUI applications for handling events like button clicks.

---

### **Disadvantages of Inner Classes**
1. **Complexity:** Can make the code harder to read and maintain.  
2. **Limited Scope:** Inner classes are tightly coupled with their enclosing class, reducing reusability.

### **Interview-Style Questions and Answers**

#### **Basic Concepts**
1. **Q:** What is the difference between a static nested class and a non-static inner class?  
   **A:**  
   - **Static Nested Class:** Does not require an instance of the outer class to be accessed.  
   - **Non-Static Inner Class:** Requires an instance of the outer class to create and access.

2. **Q:** What is the purpose of inner classes?  
   **A:** Inner classes are used for better organization of code, logical grouping, and improved encapsulation of functionality.

---

#### **Local and Anonymous Inner Classes**
3. **Q:** Can a local inner class access variables of its enclosing method?  
   **A:** Yes, but the variables must be declared `final` or effectively final.

4. **Q:** When should you use anonymous inner classes?  
   **A:** Use anonymous inner classes for one-time implementations, such as event listeners in GUI applications.

---

#### **Advanced Concepts**
5. **Q:** What is the scope of a local inner class?  
   **A:** A local inner class is accessible only within the method or block in which it is defined.

6. **Q:** Can inner classes be abstract?  
   **A:** Yes, inner classes can be abstract, and their methods must be implemented by subclasses.

---

#### **Practical Scenarios**
7. **Q:** How do anonymous inner classes simplify code in GUI applications?  
   **A:** By providing concise implementations of event listeners, anonymous inner classes reduce boilerplate code.

8. **Q:** Why would you use a static nested class in a multi-threaded environment?  
   **A:** A static nested class does not rely on an instance of the outer class, so it can be safely used in multi-threaded environments without synchronization.
