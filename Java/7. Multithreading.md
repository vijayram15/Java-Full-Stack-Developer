Let’s move on to **7. Multithreading and Concurrency**, a key concept in Java for building highly responsive and scalable applications.

---

### **What is Multithreading?**

- **Definition:** Multithreading is a feature in Java that allows the execution of two or more threads simultaneously, enabling better CPU utilization and improved performance for concurrent tasks.
- **Thread:** A lightweight process that runs independently within a program.

---

### **Why Use Multithreading?**

1. **Concurrency:** Execute multiple tasks simultaneously, improving program responsiveness.  
2. **Resource Utilization:** Efficiently utilize system resources like CPU cores.  
3. **Parallelism:** Perform intensive computations or handle multiple I/O operations at once.

---

### **Life Cycle of a Thread**

1. **New:** A thread is created using the `Thread` class or `Runnable` interface.  
   ```java
   Thread t = new Thread();
   ```
2. **Runnable:** The thread is ready to run but is waiting for CPU time.  
   ```java
   t.start();
   ```
3. **Running:** The thread is executing.  
4. **Blocked/Waiting:** The thread is waiting for a resource or condition.  
5. **Terminated:** The thread has completed execution.

### **Creating Threads**

There are two primary ways to create threads in Java:

#### **1. Extending the Thread Class**
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t = new MyThread();
        t.start();
    }
}
```

#### **2. Implementing the Runnable Interface**
```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        t.start();
    }
}
```

### **Thread Synchronization**

When multiple threads access shared resources, synchronization ensures thread safety and prevents data inconsistency.

- **Using synchronized Blocks or Methods:**
  ```java
  public class Counter {
      private int count = 0;

      public synchronized void increment() {
          count++;
      }
  }
  ```

- **Lock Interface:** Provides more flexible thread synchronization.
  ```java
  import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

  ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
  lock.lock();
  try {
      // Critical section
  } finally {
      lock.unlock();
  }
  ```

---

### **Concurrency Utilities (java.util.concurrent)**

- **Executor Framework:** Manages thread pools for efficient thread execution.  
  ```java
  ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
  executor.execute(new MyRunnable());
  executor.shutdown();
  ```

- **CountDownLatch:** Synchronize threads by allowing them to wait until a set of operations is completed.  
  ```java
  CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(2);
  latch.countDown();
  latch.await();
  ```

- **Future and Callable:** Handle asynchronous tasks and retrieve their results.  
  ```java
  Future<Integer> result = executor.submit(() -> 5 + 5);
  int sum = result.get();  // Output: 10
  ```

---

### **Deadlock and Its Prevention**

- **Deadlock:** Occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other’s resources, causing a standstill.  
  - Example:
    ```java
    synchronized (resource1) {
        synchronized (resource2) {
            // Deadlock possibility
        }
    }
    ```
- **Prevention:**  
  1. Lock resources in the same order.  
  2. Use `tryLock()` with a timeout.

### **Interview-Style Questions and Answers**

#### **Basic Concepts**
1. **Q:** What is the difference between a process and a thread?  
   **A:**  
   - **Process:** A program in execution, with its own memory space.  
   - **Thread:** A lightweight unit of execution within a process, sharing the process’s memory.

2. **Q:** How do you create threads in Java?  
   **A:** By extending the `Thread` class or implementing the `Runnable` interface.

---

#### **Thread Safety**
3. **Q:** What is thread safety, and how do you achieve it?  
   **A:** Thread safety ensures that multiple threads can access shared resources without causing data corruption. It is achieved using **synchronized blocks**, **locks**, or **concurrent utilities**.

4. **Q:** What is the difference between `synchronized` and `Lock`?  
   **A:**  
   - `synchronized` is simpler but less flexible.  
   - `Lock` provides finer control, allowing try-locking and fair locking.

---

#### **Concurrency Challenges**
5. **Q:** What is a deadlock, and how do you avoid it?  
   **A:** A deadlock occurs when threads are waiting indefinitely for each other's resources. Avoid it by locking resources in a consistent order or using `tryLock()`.

6. **Q:** What is the difference between ExecutorService and creating threads manually?  
   **A:** ExecutorService manages thread pools, improving performance and resource utilization compared to manually creating threads.

---

#### **Advanced**
7. **Q:** How does the `volatile` keyword work in Java?  
   **A:** The `volatile` keyword ensures visibility of changes to a variable across threads, preventing caching issues. However, it doesn’t provide atomicity.

8. **Q:** What is the purpose of the `join()` method in threads?  
   **A:** The `join()` method ensures that the current thread waits for another thread to complete before continuing execution.
