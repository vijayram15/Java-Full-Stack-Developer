You're absolutely right, I jumped ahead earlier. Let's get back on track with our previous order and focus on **5. Exception Handling**—an essential topic for writing robust and error-resilient Java programs. Let's dive in.

---

### **What is Exception Handling in Java?**
Exception Handling is a mechanism in Java that allows you to gracefully handle runtime errors, ensuring the program doesn't crash and continues running smoothly.

- **Exception:** An unwanted or unexpected event that disrupts the normal flow of the program.  
- **Error vs. Exception:**
  - **Errors**: Irrecoverable issues, e.g., `OutOfMemoryError`.  
  - **Exceptions**: Recoverable issues, e.g., `IOException`, `NullPointerException`.

---

### **Types of Exceptions**
1. **Checked Exceptions:**
   - Checked at compile-time.  
   - Examples: `IOException`, `SQLException`.  
   - Must be handled using `try-catch` or declared in the method signature using `throws`.

2. **Unchecked Exceptions (Runtime Exceptions):**
   - Occur at runtime and are not checked at compile-time.  
   - Examples: `NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  
   - Handling them is optional.

---

### **Exception Hierarchy**
1. `Throwable` (Superclass of all exceptions)
   - **Error:** Critical issues, e.g., `StackOverflowError`.  
   - **Exception:** Recoverable issues.  
     - **Checked Exceptions:** `IOException`, `SQLException`.  
     - **Unchecked Exceptions:** `RuntimeException` and its subclasses.

---

### **How to Handle Exceptions**
#### **1. Using try-catch Block**
- Catches the exception and executes alternate code:
  ```java
  try {
      int result = 10 / 0;  // ArithmeticException
  } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
      System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero!");
  }
  ```

#### **2. Using Multiple catch Blocks**
- Handle different exceptions separately:
  ```java
  try {
      int[] arr = {1, 2};
      System.out.println(arr[5]);  // ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
  } catch (NullPointerException e) {
      System.out.println("Null Pointer Exception");
  } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
      System.out.println("Array Index Out of Bounds");
  }
  ```

#### **3. Using finally Block**
- Always executes, regardless of exception occurrence:
  ```java
  try {
      int result = 10 / 0;
  } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
      System.out.println("Exception caught");
  } finally {
      System.out.println("This block always executes");
  }
  ```

#### **4. Using throws Keyword**
- Declare exceptions in the method signature:
  ```java
  public void readFile() throws IOException {
      // Throws IOException
  }
  ```

### **Creating Custom Exceptions**
You can define your own exception by extending the `Exception` class or `RuntimeException` class:
```java
class CustomException extends Exception {
    public CustomException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            throw new CustomException("This is a custom exception");
        } catch (CustomException e) {
            System.out.println(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

### **Advantages of Exception Handling**
1. Prevents program crashes by catching and handling errors gracefully.  
2. Helps separate error-handling logic from core functionality.  
3. Promotes robust, maintainable, and clean code.

### **Interview-Style Questions and Answers**

#### **Basic Concepts**
1. **Q:** What is the difference between Checked and Unchecked Exceptions?  
   **A:**  
   - **Checked Exceptions:** Checked at compile-time (e.g., `IOException`), must be declared using `throws` or handled.  
   - **Unchecked Exceptions:** Occur at runtime (e.g., `NullPointerException`), no need to declare or handle.

2. **Q:** What’s the purpose of the `finally` block?  
   **A:** The `finally` block executes code regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It’s typically used for resource cleanup like closing a file or database connection.

---

#### **Error vs. Exception**
3. **Q:** Can you recover from an `Error`?  
   **A:** Generally, **no**. Errors like `OutOfMemoryError` or `StackOverflowError` indicate serious issues, and recovery is not possible.

4. **Q:** What happens if an exception is not handled?  
   **A:** If not handled, the JVM stops executing the program and prints a stack trace.

---

#### **Advanced**
5. **Q:** How would you create a custom exception in Java?  
   **A:** Extend the `Exception` or `RuntimeException` class and provide a constructor to accept a custom message.  
   Example:
   ```java
   class MyException extends Exception {
       public MyException(String message) {
           super(message);
       }
   }
   ```

6. **Q:** Why should you prefer specific exceptions over general exceptions?  
   **A:** Catching specific exceptions (like `IOException`) makes debugging easier and avoids unintended behavior. Catching general exceptions (like `Exception`) may hide other errors.

---

#### **Practical Scenarios**
7. **Q:** How would you handle a situation where a file might not exist?  
   **A:** Use a `try-catch` block to handle `FileNotFoundException`:  
   ```java
   try {
       FileInputStream file = new FileInputStream("file.txt");
   } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
       System.out.println("File not found");
   }
   ```

8. **Q:** What is the difference between `throw` and `throws`?  
   **A:**  
   - **`throw`**: Used to explicitly throw an exception.  
   - **`throws`**: Used in method signatures to declare exceptions that can be thrown.
