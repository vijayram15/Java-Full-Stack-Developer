Here's a detailed explanation of each difference, focusing on important additions across the specified JDK versions:

---

### **JDK 5 to JDK 6**
1. **Performance Improvements**:
   - JDK 6 brought optimizations to the HotSpot JVM, significantly improving application startup time and runtime performance.
   - The garbage collection algorithms were enhanced, making memory management more efficient.

2. **Scripting Support**:
   - Introduced the `javax.script` package, enabling integration of scripting languages (like JavaScript) with Java applications.
   - This allowed developers to embed scripts directly within Java code.

3. **Web Services**:
   - Added JAX-WS for creating RESTful and SOAP-based web services.
   - JAXB provided a way to bind XML data to Java objects, making XML data handling easier.

4. **Compiler API**:
   - Developers could now interact with the Java compiler programmatically using the `javax.tools` package.
   - This was especially useful for tools that generate or analyze Java code on the fly.

5. **Monitoring and Management**:
   - The JMX enhancements made it easier to monitor and manage Java applications.
   - `jconsole` provided a graphical interface for viewing JVM stats like memory usage and thread activity.

### **JDK 6 to JDK 8**
1. **Lambda Expressions**:
   - Introduced in JDK 8, lambdas enabled functional-style programming.
   - Example: `(x) -> x * x` simplifies the definition of inline functions.

2. **Stream API**:
   - Enabled processing of collections in a declarative way. You could filter, map, and reduce data seamlessly.
   - Example: `list.stream().filter(x -> x > 10).collect(Collectors.toList())`.

3. **Date and Time API**:
   - Replaced the outdated `java.util.Date` and `Calendar` with the `java.time` package.
   - It added classes like `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, and `ZonedDateTime`, making date and time manipulation intuitive.

4. **Default Methods**:
   - Interfaces could now have method implementations. This allowed backward compatibility without breaking existing code.
   - Example: `default void myMethod() { System.out.println("Hello!"); }`.

5. **Nashorn JavaScript Engine**:
   - Nashorn replaced the Rhino engine, offering better support for JavaScript integration in Java applications.

6. **PermGen Removal**:
   - The removal of PermGen in favor of Metaspace simplified memory management, reducing OutOfMemory errors.

### **JDK 8 to JDK 17**
1. **Modules (Project Jigsaw)**:
   - JDK 9 introduced the module system (`module-info.java`), allowing developers to break applications into smaller, manageable modules.
   - Example: `requires java.base;` specifies module dependencies.

2. **Local Variable Type Inference**:
   - JDK 10 added the `var` keyword, allowing type inference for local variables.
   - Example: `var list = new ArrayList<String>();`.

3. **Text Blocks**:
   - JDK 13 introduced text blocks, allowing multi-line strings with ease and readability.
   - Example:
     ```
     String text = """
     Hello,
     World!
     """;
     ```

4. **Switch Expressions**:
   - Enhanced switch statements in JDK 12 and finalized in JDK 14, simplifying branching logic.
   - Example:
     ```
     String result = switch (input) {
         case "A" -> "Alpha";
         case "B" -> "Beta";
         default -> "Unknown";
     };
     ```

5. **Sealed Classes**:
   - Introduced in JDK 15, sealed classes restrict class hierarchies.
   - Example: `public sealed class Vehicle permits Car, Bike {}`.

6. **Pattern Matching**:
   - JDK 16 simplified `instanceof` checks by introducing pattern matching.
   - Example:
     ```
     if (obj instanceof String s) {
         System.out.println(s.toUpperCase());
     }
     ```

7. **Performance and Security**:
   - Continuous improvements in garbage collectors like G1GC and ZGC enhanced application performance.
   - Stronger cryptographic algorithms improved security.

8. **Long-Term Support (LTS)**:
   - JDK 17 provides stability and extended support, making it ideal for enterprise applications.
