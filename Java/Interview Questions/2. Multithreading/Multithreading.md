Let’s shift our focus to **Multithreading** in Java, one of the most challenging and rewarding topics in software development. I'll cover advanced concepts, practical insights, and tricky interview questions to prepare you thoroughly.

---

### **What Is Multithreading in Java?**
Multithreading is the ability to run multiple threads of execution simultaneously within a program. Threads are lightweight processes that share the same memory space but execute independently, enabling concurrency and parallelism.

---

### **Core Concepts in Multithreading**

#### **1. Thread Life Cycle**
Threads in Java go through five states:
1. **New:** Created but not yet started (e.g., `Thread t = new Thread()`).
2. **Runnable:** Ready to run but waiting for CPU time (e.g., after calling `start()`).
3. **Running:** Actively executing.
4. **Blocked/Waiting:** Waiting for a resource or condition.
5. **Terminated:** Completed execution.

#### **2. Ways to Create Threads**
There are two main ways to create threads in Java:
1. **Extending `Thread` Class**
   ```java
   class MyThread extends Thread {
       public void run() {
           System.out.println("Thread is running...");
       }
   }
   new MyThread().start();
   ```

2. **Implementing `Runnable` Interface**
   ```java
   class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
       public void run() {
           System.out.println("Thread is running...");
       }
   }
   new Thread(new MyRunnable()).start();
   ```

#### **3. Thread Synchronization**
Synchronization ensures thread safety when threads access shared resources.
- **Synchronized Methods or Blocks:**
  ```java
  public synchronized void increment() {
      counter++;
  }
  ```

- **Lock Interface:**
  ```java
  ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
  lock.lock();
  try {
      // Critical section
  } finally {
      lock.unlock();
  }
  ```

#### **4. Advanced Concurrency Features**
- **Executor Framework:** Manage thread pools for efficient execution.
- **Semaphore:** Control access to a resource with permits.
- **Future/Callable:** Return results from threads.

---

### **Tricky Interview Questions on Multithreading**

#### **1. What is the difference between `Runnable` and `Callable`?**

**Answer:**
- **Runnable:**
  - Does not return a result.
  - Cannot throw checked exceptions.
  ```java
  Runnable task = () -> System.out.println("Runnable Task");
  new Thread(task).start();
  ```

- **Callable:**
  - Returns a result via the `call()` method.
  - Can throw checked exceptions.
  ```java
  Callable<Integer> task = () -> 42;
  Future<Integer> future = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor().submit(task);
  System.out.println(future.get());
  ```

---

#### **2. Why is `volatile` not sufficient for thread safety?**

**Answer:**
The `volatile` keyword ensures **visibility** but not **atomicity**. For compound actions like `counter++` (read-modify-write), multiple threads can still interfere.

**Solution:**
Use `AtomicInteger` for atomic operations:
```java
AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger();
counter.incrementAndGet();
```

---

#### **3. How does the `synchronized` keyword work internally?**

**Answer:**
When a thread enters a synchronized block or method:
1. It acquires the **intrinsic lock (monitor)** on the object or class.
2. Other threads attempting to access synchronized code must wait until the lock is released.
3. The lock ensures **mutual exclusion** but comes with performance overhead.

---

#### **4. What is the difference between `wait()`, `notify()`, and `notifyAll()`?**

**Answer:**
- **`wait()`**: Makes the current thread release the intrinsic lock and enter the **waiting state**.
- **`notify()`**: Wakes up one waiting thread.
- **`notifyAll()`**: Wakes up all waiting threads.

**Example:**
```java
synchronized(obj) {
    obj.wait();    // Release lock and wait
    obj.notify();  // Wake up one thread
}
```

---

#### **5. What causes a deadlock, and how can it be avoided?**

**Answer:**
- **Cause:** Two or more threads hold locks and wait for each other to release them, resulting in a circular wait.
- **Prevention Strategies:**
  1. Lock resources in a consistent order.
  2. Use `tryLock()` with a timeout to avoid indefinite blocking.
  3. Detect and resolve deadlocks using tools like thread dumps.

**Example of Deadlock:**
```java
synchronized (lock1) {
    synchronized (lock2) {
        // Deadlock potential
    }
}
```

---

#### **6. How does the `ThreadLocal` class work?**

**Answer:**
`ThreadLocal` provides thread-specific variables. Each thread gets its own isolated copy.

**Example:**
```java
ThreadLocal<Integer> threadLocal = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> 1);
System.out.println(threadLocal.get());  // Output: 1
```

**Use Case:** Maintaining user session data in a web application.

---

#### **7. What is the difference between a `Semaphore` and a `CountDownLatch`?**

**Answer:**
- **Semaphore:**
  - Controls access to a resource using permits.
  - Permits can be increased or decreased dynamically.
  ```java
  Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(3);  // 3 permits
  semaphore.acquire();
  semaphore.release();
  ```

- **CountDownLatch:**
  - Allows threads to wait until a specific number of events have occurred (count reaches 0).
  - The count cannot be reset.
  ```java
  CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(2);
  latch.countDown();
  latch.await();
  ```

---

#### **8. What is the role of `ForkJoinPool` in Java?**

**Answer:**
`ForkJoinPool` is a special thread pool optimized for **divide-and-conquer algorithms**. It splits tasks into smaller subtasks and executes them in parallel.

**Example:**
```java
ForkJoinPool pool = new ForkJoinPool();
pool.invoke(new RecursiveTask<Integer>() {
    protected Integer compute() { return 1; }
});
```

---

### **Real-World Scenarios for Multithreading**

#### **1. Web Server:**
Each incoming HTTP request is handled by a separate thread from a thread pool (using `ExecutorService`).

#### **2. Stock Market Data Processing:**
Use `ConcurrentHashMap` to maintain the latest stock prices, updated simultaneously by multiple threads.

#### **3. Background Processing:**
Handle tasks like email sending or report generation in background threads using scheduled thread pools.

### **1. Thread Pools and Executor Framework**

#### **What Are Thread Pools?**
Thread pools manage a group of pre-instantiated threads for executing tasks. They reduce the overhead of thread creation and provide better resource utilization.

#### **Executor Framework**
The **java.util.concurrent.Executor** framework provides powerful thread pool implementations for managing tasks.

- **Types of Thread Pools:**
  1. **FixedThreadPool:** A pool with a fixed number of threads. Ideal for limited threads performing predictable workloads.
     ```java
     ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
     executor.execute(() -> System.out.println("Task executed"));
     executor.shutdown();
     ```

  2. **CachedThreadPool:** A pool that creates new threads as needed but reuses previously created threads.
     ```java
     ExecutorService executor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
     ```

  3. **SingleThreadExecutor:** A pool with just one thread. Ensures tasks are executed sequentially.
     ```java
     ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
     ```

  4. **ScheduledThreadPool:** For scheduling tasks at fixed rates or delays.
     ```java
     ScheduledExecutorService executor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(3);
     executor.schedule(() -> System.out.println("Task scheduled"), 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
     ```

---

### **2. ForkJoinPool and RecursiveTask**

#### **What Is ForkJoinPool?**
ForkJoinPool is a thread pool for **divide-and-conquer algorithms**, splitting tasks into smaller subtasks recursively.

#### **RecursiveTask Example**
Use `RecursiveTask` for tasks that return a result.
```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

class SumTask extends RecursiveTask<Integer> {
    private int[] arr;
    private int start, end;

    public SumTask(int[] arr, int start, int end) {
        this.arr = arr;
        this.start = start;
        this.end = end;
    }

    @Override
    protected Integer compute() {
        if (end - start <= 5) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int i = start; i < end; i++) sum += arr[i];
            return sum;
        }
        int mid = (start + end) / 2;
        SumTask leftTask = new SumTask(arr, start, mid);
        SumTask rightTask = new SumTask(arr, mid, end);
        leftTask.fork();
        return rightTask.compute() + leftTask.join();
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ForkJoinPool pool = new ForkJoinPool();
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
        SumTask task = new SumTask(arr, 0, arr.length);
        System.out.println(pool.invoke(task));  // Output: 55
    }
}
```

### **3. Advanced Synchronization Mechanisms**

#### **ReentrantLock**
Provides explicit locking with additional features:
- **Fairness Policy:** Ensures threads acquire locks in order.
- **Interruptible Lock Acquisition:** Threads can interrupt lock acquisition.

```java
ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock(true);  // Fair lock
lock.lock();
try {
    System.out.println("Critical section");
} finally {
    lock.unlock();
}
```

---

#### **ReadWriteLock**
Optimizes read-heavy workloads by allowing multiple readers and a single writer.

```java
ReadWriteLock rwLock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
rwLock.readLock().lock();
try {
    System.out.println("Reading");
} finally {
    rwLock.readLock().unlock();
}
rwLock.writeLock().lock();
try {
    System.out.println("Writing");
} finally {
    rwLock.writeLock().unlock();
}
```

---

### **4. CompletableFuture**

#### **What Is CompletableFuture?**
Introduced in Java 8, it represents an asynchronous computation and provides powerful methods for chaining tasks and handling results.

#### **Example:**
```java
CompletableFuture<String> future = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    return "Hello";
}).thenApply(result -> result + ", World!")
  .thenAccept(System.out::println);
```

#### **Key Methods:**
1. **supplyAsync():** Starts an asynchronous task.
2. **thenApply():** Chains a computation task.
3. **thenAccept():** Consumes the result without returning a value.
4. **join():** Waits for the completion and retrieves the result.

---

### **5. Parallel Streams**

#### **What Are Parallel Streams?**
Parallel Streams enable automatic multi-threading for data processing.

#### **How It Works:**
Parallel Streams split the input data and process parts concurrently using a common ForkJoinPool.

#### **Example:**
```java
List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8);
int sum = list.parallelStream().reduce(0, Integer::sum);
System.out.println(sum);  // Output: 36
```

---

### **6. Deadlock Detection and Prevention**

#### **Deadlock Detection:**
Deadlocks can be identified using thread dumps, which show blocked threads waiting for locks.

#### **Prevention Strategies:**
1. **Consistent Lock Ordering:**
   Always acquire locks in a fixed order.

2. **Timeouts:**
   Use `tryLock()` to prevent indefinite blocking.
   ```java
   if (lock.tryLock(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
       try { /* Critical section */ }
       finally { lock.unlock(); }
   }
   ```

3. **Avoid Nested Locks:**
   Minimize nesting locks wherever possible.

### **Interview-Style Questions**

#### **Advanced Synchronization**
1. **Q:** What is the difference between `synchronized` and `ReentrantLock`?  
   **A:** `synchronized` is simpler but less flexible. `ReentrantLock` allows:
   - Fair locking.
   - Interruptible lock acquisition.
   - Explicit lock/unlock control.

---

#### **Executor Framework**
2. **Q:** When would you use a `ScheduledThreadPool`?  
   **A:** Use it for repetitive tasks like periodic monitoring or cleanup.

---

#### **CompletableFuture**
3. **Q:** What is the advantage of `CompletableFuture` over traditional thread pools?  
   **A:** It simplifies asynchronous programming with methods for chaining tasks and handling results elegantly.

---

#### **ForkJoinPool**
4. **Q:** What is the difference between `ForkJoinPool` and `ExecutorService`?  
   **A:** ForkJoinPool is optimized for recursive tasks, while ExecutorService is designed for general-purpose thread management.
