### **1. Docker Basics**
   - Core Concepts: Containers vs. virtual machines, Docker architecture.
   - Advantages: Portability, resource efficiency, scalability.
   - Common Commands: `docker run`, `docker ps`, `docker stop`, `docker logs`.

---

### **2. Dockerfile**
   - Purpose: Defining a container's build instructions.
   - Key Directives: 
     - `FROM`: Base image.
     - `RUN`: Executes commands to install dependencies.
     - `CMD` vs `ENTRYPOINT`: Specifying the containerâ€™s default action.
     - `COPY` and `ADD`: Adding files to images.
   - Multi-Stage Builds: Optimizing image sizes by separating build and runtime stages.

---

### **3. Container Management**
   - Managing Containers: Start, stop, restart, remove containers.
   - Inspecting Containers: Checking logs, resource usage, and configurations.
   - Networking:
     - Bridge Networks for internal communication between containers.
     - Host Networks for external communication.

---

### **4. Docker Compose**
   - Purpose: Managing multi-container applications.
   - Structure: Defining services, networks, and volumes in `docker-compose.yml`.
   - Commands: `docker-compose up`, `docker-compose down`.

---

### **5. Docker and Kubernetes**
   - Orchestration: The need for Kubernetes with Docker in larger systems.
   - Transition from Docker Compose to Kubernetes YAML files.

---

### **6. Volumes and Networking**
   - Volumes: Persistent data storage across container lifecycles.
   - Networking Concepts:
     - Exposing container ports (`-p` flag).
     - Container-to-container communication within the same network.

---

### **7. Docker in CI/CD**
   - Using Docker in build pipelines.
   - Automating image builds and deployments with tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or AWS CodePipeline.

---

### **8. Troubleshooting and Optimization**
   - Debugging: Handling container crashes, viewing logs.
   - Optimizing: Reducing image size using minimal base images, avoiding unnecessary layers.
   - Cleaning Up: Removing unused images, containers, and volumes with `docker system prune`.
