Sure thing! Here's a simple example of Java code demonstrating a basic "Hello, World!" program:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Print a greeting to the console
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

If you'd like to explore a specific concept in Java—such as multithreading, collections, or something else—let me know, and I can tailor the example accordingly!
