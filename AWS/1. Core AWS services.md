### **1. Compute**
AWS offers several compute services designed to handle various workloads and deployment strategies:
- **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):**  
  Virtual servers in the cloud that allow you to launch instances with customizable configurations. You can scale up or down based on demand.  
  *Use Case:* Running web servers, databases, or custom applications.
  
- **ECS (Elastic Container Service):**  
  A managed container orchestration service that allows you to run and manage Docker containers. It can integrate with Fargate for serverless container deployment.  
  *Use Case:* Microservices architecture using Docker containers.

- **Lambda:**  
  A serverless compute service that lets you run code in response to events without managing servers. You pay only for the compute time consumed.  
  *Use Case:* Processing event streams, automating backend tasks, or building APIs with minimal infrastructure management.

### **2. Storage**
Storage options on AWS cater to various needs, from object storage to file systems:
- **S3 (Simple Storage Service):**  
  An object storage solution to store and retrieve large amounts of data. It's highly scalable, durable, and cost-effective.  
  *Use Case:* Backups, static website hosting, or storing multimedia files.

- **EBS (Elastic Block Store):**  
  Provides block storage for use with EC2 instances. It's optimized for both throughput and transactional workloads.  
  *Use Case:* Running databases or operating systems requiring persistent storage.

- **EFS (Elastic File System):**  
  A scalable and elastic file storage solution that allows multiple EC2 instances to access the same data.  
  *Use Case:* File sharing across applications, or high-performance content management systems.

---

### **3. Databases**
AWS supports a wide range of database solutions for different applications:
- **RDS (Relational Database Service):**  
  A managed service for relational databases, supporting engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server. It handles routine tasks like backups and scaling.  
  *Use Case:* Applications requiring structured data storage, such as e-commerce or CRM systems.

- **DynamoDB:**  
  A fully managed NoSQL database service designed for fast and flexible performance with key-value and document data models.  
  *Use Case:* Real-time analytics, gaming leaderboards, or IoT applications.

- **Aurora:**  
  A relational database built for the cloud, offering high performance and availability. It’s compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL.  
  *Use Case:* High-throughput applications, like SaaS platforms or financial systems.

---

### **4. Networking**
AWS provides networking services to securely connect and route traffic within and outside the cloud:
- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):**  
  Lets you create a private network within AWS where you can launch resources with full control over IP addressing, subnets, and routing.  
  *Use Case:* Isolating sensitive workloads or setting up hybrid connectivity with on-premise systems.

- **Load Balancers (Application/Network):**  
  Distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets, enhancing fault tolerance and scalability. Application Load Balancers work at the application layer, while Network Load Balancers handle low-latency traffic.  
  *Use Case:* Ensuring high availability for web applications or APIs.

- **Route 53:**  
  A scalable and highly available domain name system (DNS) web service. It also supports routing policies for directing traffic based on various criteria.  
  *Use Case:* Managing custom domains, DNS failover, and traffic routing.

These core AWS services form the foundation for building, deploying, and maintaining scalable and resilient applications.

For a Java Full Stack Developer, questions about AWS often focus on understanding the core services and their practical applications. Interviewers are likely to assess your knowledge of how these services integrate into a full-stack development environment. Below are sample questions and concise answers that might come up:

---

### **Compute**
1. **What is EC2, and how can it be used in a Java application?**  
   - EC2 is a virtual server in the cloud. You can deploy your Java-based backend applications on EC2 instances, scale them based on user demand, and configure the instance for optimal performance.

2. **How does AWS Lambda differ from EC2?**  
   - Lambda is serverless, meaning you don’t need to manage servers. It runs your code in response to events, making it ideal for lightweight Java microservices or backend APIs that don’t require persistent infrastructure.

---

### **Storage**
3. **How would you use S3 in a Java application?**  
   - S3 can be used to store and retrieve files like logs, user-uploaded images, or backups. You can integrate with Java using AWS SDK to interact with S3 buckets programmatically.

4. **What is the difference between EBS and EFS? Which one would you choose for your Java application?**  
   - EBS is block storage tied to EC2 instances, suitable for database applications or storage that needs high performance. EFS is a shared file system for distributed applications. Choose EBS for transactional databases and EFS for shared file storage.

---

### **Databases**
5. **How can you use RDS for Java applications?**  
   - RDS provides managed relational databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL. You can connect your Java application to RDS via JDBC for database operations without worrying about maintenance.

6. **What is DynamoDB, and why would you use it in a Java project?**  
   - DynamoDB is a NoSQL database offering high scalability and performance. Use it for projects requiring key-value or document-based data storage, such as caching or real-time analytics.

---

### **Networking**
7. **What is the role of VPC in AWS?**  
   - VPC creates an isolated network for your resources. In Java applications, it helps ensure secure communication between servers, databases, and other resources.

8. **How would you use an Application Load Balancer in a Java-based web application?**  
   - An ALB distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of your Java web application, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.

9. **Can you explain Route 53 and its role in DNS management for AWS resources?**  
   - Route 53 manages DNS records, allowing you to direct traffic to your Java-based web servers hosted on EC2. It supports advanced routing mechanisms, such as failover or geolocation-based routing.
