Hereâ€™s the detailed breakdown of points that come under **Microservices Architecture**:

---

### **1. Concepts & Principles**
   - Definition and core principles of microservices.
   - Characteristics like scalability, maintainability, and decentralized data management.
   - Key comparison with monolithic architecture.

---

### **2. Inter-Service Communication**
   - Communication mechanisms: REST APIs, gRPC, and asynchronous messaging (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).
   - Synchronous vs. asynchronous communication: When and why to use each.
   - Handling inter-service dependencies and failures.

---

### **3. Data Management**
   - Database per service pattern.
   - Data consistency: Eventual consistency and distributed transactions (SAGA pattern).
   - Challenges with cross-service queries.

---

### **4. Service Deployment**
   - On-premise vs. cloud-based deployment.
   - Using containers (Docker) for microservices.
   - Deployment strategies: Blue-green, Canary, and Rolling updates.

---

### **5. Design Patterns**
   - Common patterns: API Gateway, Circuit Breaker, Aggregator pattern.
   - Domain-Driven Design (DDD) concepts like Bounded Context.
   - Event Sourcing and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS).

---

### **6. Resilience & Fault Tolerance**
   - Implementing retry mechanisms and circuit breakers.
   - Bulkhead pattern to limit resource contention.
   - Graceful service degradation and fallback strategies.

---

### **7. Monitoring & Logging**
   - Centralized logging with tools like ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
   - Distributed tracing tools like Jaeger, Zipkin.
   - Monitoring service health and performance with Prometheus and Grafana.

---

### **8. Scalability**
   - Horizontal vs. vertical scaling.
   - Load balancing between service instances.
   - Stateless services and session management.
