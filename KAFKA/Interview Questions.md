### **Kafka and Spring Boot Questions**
1. How do you integrate Kafka with a Spring Boot application?
2. What are the key configurations for Kafka producers and consumers in Spring Boot?
3. How would you implement retry and error handling in a Spring Kafka application?
4. How does `@KafkaListener` work in Spring Boot?
5. Explain how to process Kafka messages in batch mode with Spring Boot.
6. How do you configure multiple consumer groups in a Spring Kafka application?
7. How would you use KafkaTemplate to send messages in Spring Boot?
8. How does Spring Kafka handle offset management?
9. What are the benefits of using `ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory` in Spring Boot?
10. How would you implement end-to-end testing for a Kafka-based Spring Boot application?

### **Scenario-Based Questions**
1. If a producer sends messages faster than consumers can process them, how would you handle this scenario?
2. You notice uneven load distribution across Kafka partitions. What steps would you take to resolve this?

4. Describe how you would implement a real-time analytics pipeline using Kafka.
5. What would you do if a Kafka broker fails in a production environment?
6. How would you scale Kafka consumers to handle increased message volume?
7. Design a system where multiple services need to consume the same Kafka topic independently.
8. How would you handle schema changes in a Kafka topic without breaking existing consumers?
9. Describe how you would secure Kafka communication in a production setup.
10. How would you set up Kafka in a cloud-native architecture?

---

### **Behavioral Questions**
1. Describe a challenging Kafka issue you faced in a project and how you resolved it.
2. How do you ensure Kafka’s reliability and performance in a production environment?
3. What best practices do you follow when working with Kafka?
4. Have you ever optimized a Kafka setup for a specific use case? If so, how?
