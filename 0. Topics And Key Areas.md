2. Inter-Service Communication: REST vs. messaging systems (Kafka), API Gateway, Service Discovery.
3. Data Management: Database per service, eventual consistency, distributed transactions.
4. Service Deployment: On-premise vs. cloud, containerization.
5. Design Patterns: Circuit Breaker, Saga, Event Sourcing.
6. Resilience & Fault Tolerance: Retry mechanisms, bulkheads, rate-limiting.
7. Monitoring & Logging: Centralized logging, distributed tracing.
8. Scalability: Horizontal scaling, load balancing.

## **2. Spring Boot**
### Key Areas:
1. Core Features: Dependency injection, autoconfiguration, application properties.
2. REST APIs: CRUD, versioning, exception handling.
3. Spring Security: OAuth2, JWT, authentication, and authorization.
4. Data Access: JPA, Hibernate, database connectivity.
5. Kafka Integration: @KafkaListener, producer/consumer settings.
6. Configuration Management: Profiles, externalized configurations.
7. Actuator and Monitoring: Exposing application health, metrics.
8. Testing: Unit testing with JUnit, mock MVC, integration testing.

## **3. Kafka**
### Key Areas:
1. Basics & Architecture: Producers, consumers, brokers, partitions, offsets.
2. Messaging Models: Publish-subscribe, consumer groups.
3. Performance: Partition strategies, consumer lag.
4. Producer & Consumer APIs: Retry mechanisms, polling strategies.
5. Error Handling: Dead-letter queues, poison messages.
6. Kafka Streams: Stateful and stateless processing.
7. Spring Boot Integration: KafkaTemplate, error handling.
8. Deployment: Multi-node clusters, monitoring tools.

## **4. React.js**
### Key Areas:
1. Fundamentals: Components, JSX, Props vs State.
2. Lifecycle & Hooks: useState, useEffect, useMemo, Context.
3. State Management: Redux, Context API.
4. Routing: React Router (lazy loading).
5. Performance Optimization: Memoization, code splitting.
6. Styling: CSS-in-JS, Styled-components.
7. Testing: Jest, React Testing Library.
8. TypeScript: Typing props, hooks.
9. Deployment: Optimized builds, environment variables.

---

## **5. Docker**
### Key Areas:
1. Docker Basics: Containers, images, Dockerfile.
2. Dockerfile: Directives (FROM, RUN, CMD, etc.), multi-stage builds.
3. Container Management: Commands, logs, networking.
4. Docker Compose: Multi-container applications.
5. Docker + Kubernetes: Orchestration basics.
6. Volumes & Networking: Persistent storage, container communication.
7. CI/CD: Pipeline integrations.
8. Troubleshooting: Debugging, optimizing image sizes.
