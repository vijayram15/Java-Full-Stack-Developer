### **1. Fundamentals**
   - Understanding components (functional vs. class-based).
   - The role of JSX in React for rendering UI elements.
   - Props for passing data and State for managing component-specific data.

---

### **2. Lifecycle Methods and Hooks**
   - Class-based lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount` and `componentWillUnmount`.
   - React Hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useReducer`, `useContext`.
   - When and why to use custom hooks.

---

### **3. State Management**
   - Managing state with Context API for lightweight global state.
   - Using Redux for complex state management.
   - Best practices for separating local state and global state.

---

### **4. Component Communication**
   - Props drilling and its alternatives (e.g., Context, Redux).
   - Passing data and functions between parent and child components.

---

### **5. Routing**
   - React Router (v6): Basics of `useNavigate`, `useParams`.
   - Implementing nested routes and dynamic routing.
   - Lazy loading and code splitting for routes.

---

### **6. Performance Optimization**
   - Preventing unnecessary re-renders with `React.memo` and `useCallback`.
   - Lazy loading components using `React.lazy` and `Suspense`.
   - Optimizing performance with memoization (`useMemo`) and virtualized lists.

---

### **7. Styling**
   - Using inline styles, traditional CSS, and CSS Modules.
   - Libraries like Styled-components and Emotion for CSS-in-JS solutions.
   - Comparison of styling approaches and their use cases.

---

### **8. Testing**
   - Unit testing React components with Jest.
   - Using React Testing Library for testing UI behavior.
   - Snapshot testing to validate UI changes over time.

---

### **9. React with TypeScript**
   - Typing functional components, props, and hooks.
   - Using interfaces and type aliases for better type safety.
   - Handling optional and default props in TypeScript.

---

### **10. Deployment**
   - Building production-ready React apps with `npm run build`.
   - Managing environment variables in `.env` files.
   - Hosting React apps on platforms like AWS S3, Netlify, or Vercel.
